John Lemon is a game created in Unity, a highly popular game engine for video game development. This game serves as a simple and interactive example project created in Unity to learn the basic principles of game development.

In the game John Lemon, the player takes control of a character named John Lemon, a lemon with legs and eyes. The main goal of the game is to help John collect as many golden lemons as possible in each level.

The game features colorful graphics and a simple 3D environment with plants and geometric objects. The player can move around using the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys on the keyboard. John Lemon can jump and interact with objects in the game world.

I have made three additional modifications to make the game more interesting.
